<h2> Introduction</h2>
Crime Rate prediction is one the important factors in society which has impact in almost all aspects of life varying from house purchase or business investment.  Without statistics, it would be impossible to create appropriate law enforcement budgets. Beyond just budgets, crime statistics are important in broader law enforcement resource allocation. For this the “Chicago Crime Rate” dataset driven from Kaggle is selected to implement a Time Series Analysis (SARIMA) on it. The model is evaluated using Residuals, RMSE, and P-RMSE metrics. The outcome of this study can be used to determine where more resources are needed, as well as where fewer resources are needed as a community grows safer. The findings of this study can be shared with the public for the public benefit.
