<h2> Introduction</h2>
The second milestone of the Predictive Analytics course project which is due by the end of week two (03/26/23) is to select a main data set to work on throughout the course. Additionally, a secondary dataset will be introduced later in this paper in case the original plan did not work out as we expected. For this, the “Chicago Crime Rate” dataset driven from Kaggle is selected as the original one. The model will be evaluated using Residuals, RMSE, and P-RMSE metrics. Likewise, the “Car Accident” dataset driven from Kaggle is being selected as the contingency plan. Moreover, later in this paper, the original dataset descriptions are presented in detail and a brief overview of the contingency is provided. Following, a general roadmap of the entire analysis process (broken down into several parts) is explained.

They can show where more resources are needed, as well as where fewer resources are needed as a community grows safer. Without statistics, it would be impossible to create appropriate law enforcement budgets. Beyond just budgets, crime statistics are important in broader law enforcement resource allocation. The findings of this study can be shared to the public for the public benfit.
